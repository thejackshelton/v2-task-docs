# Tasks

Tasks are how your application responds to change.

When you're building an application, things change constantly. Users type in inputs, data arrives from servers, timers fire, or components get updated. Tasks help you manage all of these changes by:

1. **Watching for changes** - Tasks track the state you care about
2. **Running your code** - When tracked state changes, your task runs again
3. **Managing side effects** - Tasks handle API calls, timers, and subscriptions
4. **Cleaning up** - Tasks clean up previous effects before running again

## The "Hello World" of Tasks

Let's start with a simple Task that runs when your component first loads:





## The Multi-Source Counter

Consider a character counter that needs to stay updated when text changes from **any source**. This example shows how Tasks help manage:
- Input validation
- API calls
- Cleanup operations
